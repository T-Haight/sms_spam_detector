# SMS Spam Detector App
Refactored code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. The model is created and trained, and a Gradio app is launched to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. The application provides feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not, based on the model's performance.


>Info: The app is launched via the Jupyter Notebook file in the main folder - gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb
